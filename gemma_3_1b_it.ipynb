            "**1. What is an AI Agent?**\n",
            "\n",
            "At its core, an AI Agent is an autonomous entity – a program or system – that can perceive its environment, reason about it, and take actions to achieve a goal.  It's essentially a digital agent that can *act* in the world, not just react to it.\n",
            "\n",
            "**2. Key Components of an AI Agent:**\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Perception:**  The agent needs to \"see\" and \"hear\" its environment. This involves sensors (cameras, microphones, sensors) that gather data about the surroundings.\n",
            "* **Reasoning:** The agent uses its knowledge and learned rules to understand the situation and make decisions. This often involves techniques like:\n",
            "    * **Planning:** Figuring out a sequence of actions to reach a goal.\n",
            "    * **Knowledge Representation:** Storing and organizing information about the world.\n",
            "    * **Reasoning:** Drawing conclusions from available information.\n",
            "* **Action Selection:**  The agent chooses the actions it will take to achieve its goals.\n",
            "* **Action Execution:** The agent carries out those actions in the environment.\n",
            "* **Feedback:** The agent receives feedback on the results of its actions, allowing it to adjust its behavior.\n",
            "\n",
            "**2. Types of AI Agents:**\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Reactive Agents:** These agents react directly to the current situation. They have no memory of past experiences. (e.g., a simple thermostat that turns on when it senses the temperature is too low.)\n",
            "* **Goal-Oriented Agents:** These agents have a specific goal and strive to achieve it. They use planning and reasoning to find the best way to reach their goal. (e.g., a robot navigating a room to find a specific object.)\n",
            "* **Autonomous Agents:** These agents can operate independently, without human intervention. They can learn and adapt to new situations. (e.g., self-driving cars, robotic assistants.)\n",
            "\n",
            "**2. Examples of AI Agents:**\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Virtual Assistants (Siri, Alexa, Google Assistant):** These agents understand voice commands and perform tasks like setting alarms, playing music, and answering questions.\n",
            "* **Robots:** Industrial robots, delivery robots, and service robots all use AI agents to perform tasks.\n",
